# Translator Documentation

## Current Projects
As of April 2019, we have one active project, bisq-desktop, in Transifex. In the near future, we are planning to start translating certain Bisq pages and core documentation. This will be announced in three major communication channels: Slack transifex channel, announcements in Transifex and on Bisq forum.

## New Translators
Anyone is welcome to become a translator by creating an account on Transifex and requesting permission to translate on https://www.transifex.com/bisq. Please note that although we welcome your contributions in a language of your choice, currently only translations for ten core languages are being compensated.

## Team Structure
Ideally, each language team has at **least two translators** who work closely with each other and contribute on a regular basis. While one translator can focus on the translation, the other can perform reviews of these translations. 

## Core Languages

This is the current list of Bisq languages whose translations/reviews are compensated as of April 2019. 

- German
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Chinese (Mandarin)
- French
- Persian
- Thai 
- Vietnamese
- Greek

The list is based on several factors such as usage of the software by the speakers of these languages (we encode the selected language within the software as a parameter when a user opens a link to a web property of ours (e.g. bisq.network or docs.bisq.network). Some users may opt out of this parameter, so this may not be a complete representation), how complete the translation for a particular language is, translator activity level, lack of competence in English among speakers of those languages, and the importance of introducing Bisq to certain countries. 

Although we have 29 languages for the bisq-desktop project, for now, we are putting the translations for the noncore languages on hold. We are going to keep them in the project, but the translation of those languages is not compensated for the moment. This is not a final list, and we can have more discussions expanding the list in the future. 

## Compensation Requests
- Here are the past compensation requests for you to gauge your own request [TODO: add github links to past comp.r]
- Please submit proof of your work along with your request. This is done to help the stakeholders validate your request.
- For translations:
  - Choose among filters *status: translated*, pick your name/nick in *users: translator*, and the translation period in *date: translated after/before*.
  - Please take snapshots of all your work for a certain period and include them in your compensation request. 
  - Here is an example of snapshots for reviewing a translation.
