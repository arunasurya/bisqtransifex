# Translator Documentation

## Current Projects
As of April 2019, we have one active project, bisq-desktop, in Transifex. In the near future, we are planning to start translating certain Bisq pages and core documentation. This will be announced in three major communication channels: Slack transifex channel, announcements in Transifex and on Bisq forum.

## New Translators
Anyone is welcome to become a translator by creating an account on Transifex and requesting permission to translate on https://www.transifex.com/bisq. Please note that although we welcome your contributions in a language of your choice, currently only translations for ten core languages are being compensated.

## Team Structure
Ideally, each language team has at **least two translators** who work closely with each other and contribute on a regular basis. While one translator can focus on the translation, the other can perform reviews of these translations.

## Translator Collaboration
One of the transifex admins will reach out to translators in each core language team to engage them and foster active collaboration. Ideally, we will have monthly translator calls to share our knowledge with one another, etc. This will be announced in the three communication channels.

## Core Languages

This is the current list of Bisq languages whose translations/reviews are compensated as of April 2019. 

- German
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Chinese (Mandarin)
- French
- Persian
- Thai 
- Vietnamese
- Greek

The list is based on several factors such as usage of the software by the speakers of these languages (we encode the selected language within the software as a parameter when a user opens a link to a web property of ours (e.g. bisq.network or docs.bisq.network). Some users may opt out of this parameter, so this may not be a complete representation), how complete the translation for a particular language is, translator activity level, poor competence in English among speakers of those languages, and the importance of introducing Bisq to certain countries. 

Although we have 29 languages for the bisq-desktop project, for now, we are putting the translations for the noncore languages on hold. We are going to keep them in the project, but the translation of those languages is not compensated for the moment. This is not a final list, and we welcome discussions and suggestions for adding/removing languages. The decision to add a new language to the list above will be mostly based on the user base in that language and the parameters outlined above.

## Compensation Requests
