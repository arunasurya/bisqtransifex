# Bisq Transifex Project - Translator Documentation

## Current Projects
The aim of the Bisq Transifex project is to produce technically accurate translations of the Bisq software and website from English into core languages (where we have a strong user base or plan to have one).

Currently, we have one active project, bisq-desktop, which involves the translation of the Bisq software into nine core languages (see below). A new project, bisq-website, is under way.

## Communication
- Daily: #transifex Slack channel.
- Major announcements: Transifex announcements and [team discussions](https://www.transifex.com/bisq/teams/69542/discussions/), [Bisq forum](https://bisq.community/t/internationalization/1700/12).

## New Translators
Anyone is welcome to become a translator by creating an account on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bisq) and requesting permission to translate. Please note that although we welcome your contributions in a language of your choice, currently only translations for the core languages, i.e.,  those in the current release, are being compensated. The list can change, depending on the demand among users in a specific language and feedback from other contributors.

## Team Structure
Ideally, each language team has at **least two translators** who work closely with each other and contribute on a regular basis. While one translator can focus on translation, the other can perform reviews of these translations, and vice versa. You can find more guidelines on translations and reviews [here](translationguidelines.md). The project is coordinated by the [Transifex admins](transifexadmin.md) and active translators. 

## Translator Collaboration
Monthly translator calls are currently being planned to bring all the interested translators together to share ideas, experiences and discuss various aspects of the project. These calls will be coordinated and moderated by one of the Transifex admins.

## Core Languages
The Bisq software is available in these languages, apart from English:
- German
- Spanish
- Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal)
- Russian
- Chinese (Mandarin)
- French
- Persian
- Thai 
- Vietnamese

Only translations/reviews in these core languages are compensated as of this moment. The list is based on several factors such as usage of the software by the speakers of these languages (we encode the selected language within the software as a parameter when a user opens a link to a web property of ours (e.g. bisq.network or docs.bisq.network), how complete the translation for a particular language is, translator activity level, poor competence in English among speakers of those languages, and the importance of introducing Bisq to certain countries. 

If there is no or a substantially decreased user interest in some of the current core languages, or no translator activity, those languages may be removed from the list. This applies especially to those languages that are not widely spoken or if they are in the European Union. If a language (such as Greek or Serbian) has been part of the core language list and was recently removed, the past work for that language is compensated.

Although we have activity in over 30 languages in the bisq-desktop project, the translation of the noncore languages is not currently compensated. This includes all past translations for those languages that have never been included in any of the Bisq releases. 

That being said, this is not a final list, and it is subject to change if there is a demand for a new language or if a good reason is given to include that language. A translator is welcome to create a [proposal](https://docs.bisq.network/proposals.html) to be voted on in the Bisq DAO to add a language. A new language is most likely to be accepted if there is an active effort to create a community and user base in that language, e.g., via meetups, [liquidity weeks](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/62), forums, etc. If there is an increased interest in a language, say Italian, and if it is accepted to the core list, then the past translations can be compensated.

Unlike typical companies, Bisq aims to increase its user base in an organic, privacy-preserving manner. This means that we don't want to do typical marketing or work with ad providers that snoop into users' privacy. Ideally, a group of contributors will act in a coordinated manner to educate potential users about Bisq via meetups, etc. So, in short, this is a dynamic process, subject primarily to user demand, translator activity, the number of speakers worldwide and competence level.

## Compensation Requests
Here are some guidelines for gauging your compensation request, based on the recent requests that have been approved:
- https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/240
- https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/241

We can start with the following range of rates and adjust them them as we get more information/feedback from the translators:
0.07 - 0.10BSQ per word for translations, 0.035 - 0.5BSQ per word for reviews.

Apart from these rates, several factors can be considered when calculating your compensation request, such as the time you have spent translating/reviewing and the country you live in. If you live somewhere with high living expenses, you can ask for a higher amount. If a certain translation required more time, you can also take that into account. Please mention these details in the request if they were factored in your compensation request.
 
There was a lot of [discussion](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/96) on this topic, and there is still no consensus on the rates. With time, as more translators submit their requests, a more consistent compensation range for translations and reviews will arise. Don't forget to make a compensation request proposal in the software in that month's voting cycle.

### Details of your work
- Please submit details of your work in your request. This is done to help the stakeholders validate your request.
- For translators:
  - Choose among filters *status: translated*, pick your name/nick in *users: translator*, and the translation period in *date: translated after/before* to specify the translation work to be compensated.
- For reviewers: use *status: reviewed*, *users: reviewer*.
- After that, tick the box right to the filter field to select all strings, and you will see the total wordcount for the selected strings.
- Please take snapshots of all your work for a certain period and include them in your compensation request. 
- Here is an example of screenshots for reviewing a translation.
