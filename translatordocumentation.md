# Bisq Transifex Project - Translator Documentation

## Current Projects
The aim of the Bisq Transifex project is to produce technically accurate translations of the Bisq software and Bisq pages & documentation into specific languages.

As of April 2019, we have one active project, bisq-desktop, in Transifex. In the near future, we are planning to start translating relevant pages on the Bisq site. This will be announced in three major translator communication channels: #transifex Slack channel, in Transifex (announcements and team discussions), and on [Bisq forum](https://bisq.community/t/internationalization/1700/12). 

## New Translators
Anyone is welcome to become a translator by creating an account on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bisq) and requesting permission to translate. Please note that although we welcome your contributions in a language of your choice, currently only translations for ten core languages (see below) are being compensated. The list can change, depending on the demand among users in a specific language and feedback from other contributors.

## Team Structure
Ideally, each language team has at **least two translators** who work closely with each other and contribute on a regular basis. While one translator can focus on translation, the other can perform reviews of these translations, and vice versa. You can learn more about guidelines on translations and reviews [here](translationguidelines.md). The project is coordinated by the [Transifex admins](transifexadmin.md) and active translators. 

## Translator Collaboration
Monthly translator calls are currently being planned to bring all the interested translators together to share ideas, experiences and discuss various aspects of the project. These calls will be coordinated and moderated by one of the Transifex admins.

## Core Languages

This is the current list of Bisq languages whose translations/reviews are compensated as of April 2019. The software is currently available in these languages which are updated with each new release.

- German
- Spanish
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Chinese (Mandarin)
- French
- Persian
- Thai 
- Vietnamese
- Greek

The list is based on several factors such as usage of the software by the speakers of these languages (we encode the selected language within the software as a parameter when a user opens a link to a web property of ours (e.g. bisq.network or docs.bisq.network), how complete the translation for a particular language is, translator activity level, poor competence in English among speakers of those languages, and the importance of introducing Bisq to certain countries. If there is no or a substantially decreased user interest in some of the current core languages, or no translator activity, those languages may be removed from the list. This applies especially to those languages that are not widely spoken.

Although we have activity in over 30 languages in the bisq-desktop project, the translation of the noncore languages is not currently compensated. This includes all past translations for those languages that have never been included in any of the Bisq releases. 

That being said, this is not a final list, and it is subject to change if there is a demand for a new language or if a good reason is given to include that language. A translator is welcome to create a [proposal](https://docs.bisq.network/proposals.html) to be voted on in the Bisq DAO to add a language. A new language is most likely to be accepted if there is an active effort to create a community and user base in that language, e.g., via meetups, [liquidity weeks](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/62), forums, etc. If there is an increased interest in a language, say Italian, and if it is accepted to the core list, then the past translations can be compensated.

Unlike typical companies, Bisq aims to increase its user base in an organic, privacy-preserving manner. This means that we don't want to do typical marketing or work with ad providers that snoop into users' privacy. Ideally, a group of contributors will act in a coordinated manner to educate potential users about Bisq via meetups, etc. Also, as we start translating certain Bisq pages, there might be an increased interest in some noncore languages as well. So, in short, this is a dynamic process, subject primarily to user demand, translator activity, the number of speakers worldwide and competence level.

## Compensation Requests
Here are some guidelines for gauging your compensation request, based on the recent requests that have been approved:
- https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/240
- https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/241
 
There was a lot of [discussion](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/96) on this topic, and there is still no consensus on the rates. With time, as more translators submit their requests, a more consistent compensation range for translations and reviews will arise that the new contributors can use for assessing their compensation requests.

### Details of your work
- Please submit details of your work in your request. This is done to help the stakeholders validate your request.
- For translators:
  - Choose among filters *status: translated*, pick your name/nick in *users: translator*, and the translation period in *date: translated after/before* to specify the translation work to be compensated.
- For reviewers: use *status: reviewed*, *users: reviewer*.
- After that, tick the box right to the filter field to select all strings, and you will see the total wordcount for the selected strings.
- Please take snapshots of all your work for a certain period and include them in your compensation request. 
- Here is an example of screenshots for reviewing a translation.
