Those translators who have been regular contributors and have shown solid knowledge of their language are given access to review. You can find more guidelines on translations and reviews [here](translationguidelines.md).

### Coordinators
Each language team has a coordinator who can assist other translators and reviewers on a daily basis. Coordinators work closely with admins to ensure a smooth workflow.

### Admins
There are two admins in the team, one acting in the primary role, and the other in the secondary role. Any coordinator who has contributed on a regular basis can become an admin.

Admin responsiblities are divided between the two Transifex admins. The admin acting in the primary role coordinates these activities to ensure that all the primary tasks are done in a timely manner. Here are some of the most important tasks:
