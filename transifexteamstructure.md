# Transifex Team Structure

The Transifex documentation specifies six roles:
- *An admin*, who has full access to all Transifex features.
- *A team manager*, who is responsible for activities in a specific team.
- *A project maintainer*, who maintains specific projects.
- *A coordinator*, who oversees a specific language within a team.
- *Reviewers*
- *Translators*

Currently in Transifex there is one Bisq team translating three projects (desktop, website and subtitles) from English into dozens of languages, out of which twelve are core (i.e., included in the software and compensated): Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), Russian, French, German, Chinese (Mandarin and traditional), Japanese, Thai, Vietnmaese and Persian.

The Bisq Transifex team consists of two admins, 12 coordinators, and many reviewers and translators. The admins encompass three Transifex roles (an admin, a project maintainer and a team manager). A project maintainer role can also be shared with other contributors whose work is vital to a specific project.

## Coordinators
A coordinator oversees activities in a specific language.

### Priviledges
A coordinator has access to the following features in their specific language:
- Accept/deny join requests and invite translators.
- Assign some translators as reviewers.
- Start a team discussion.
- Review translations.
- Submit translations.

### Responsibilities
A coordinator is responsible for ensuring the quality, consistency and timeliness of translations in their language.
Coordinators actively participate in the Bisq DAO by voting up or down proposals by the translators in their team. In addition, a coordinator is available to guide new translators, help resolve Transifex issues in their language, and explore opportunities to expand Bisq in their region.

Any coordinator who has contributed on a regular basis can become an admin once the position is open.

## Admins
There are two admins in the project (@arunasurya and @ripcurlx on Keybase/@riclas in Transifex). 

### Responsibilities
An admin acting in the primary role ensures that all essential tasks have been completed. Their responsibilities are:
- Create [reports](https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/20) for each Bisq DAO cycle which include translation activity for that period, expense reports, statistics and other relevant metrics about the projects.
- Host monthly [translator calls](translatorcalls.md).
- Update translations for all core languages in the [new client release](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestones).
  - Inform translators of the planned update, ideally a week before it happens.
- Provide clear documentation to help translators do their work effectively and keep it updated.
- Review statistics (YouTube, etc) to evaluate user activity in that language.
- Moderate three major communication channels: #transifex Keybase channel, announcements in Transifex, Bisq forum.
- Keep general information in *Setting* on Transifex updated (for all Transifex projects).
- Ensure that [issues on Transifex](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P4JMLrcRtSWkxfh9jG7AXkfdgdkEYwgttGgly-ercXc/edit#gid=0) are addressed and resolved.
- Work closely with coordinators in ensuring the timely delivery of quality translations.
- Oversee the creation of a comprehensive glossary that is consistent across all core languages, and a style guide that can set standards for all translations.
