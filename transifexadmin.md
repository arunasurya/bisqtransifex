# Transifex Admin

The Transifex admin role is shared by two contributors, one acting in the primary role, and the other acting in the secondary role. This is done to ensure a smooth workflow.

## Tasks
The tasks are divided between the two Transifex admins. The admin acting in the primary role coordinates these activities to ensure that all the primary tasks are done in a timely manner.

### Primary
- Create [monthly reports](https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/20).
- Update the translations for all core languages for each new release.
  - Inform the translators of the planned update a week before the update.
- Provide clear and updated documentation for translators (compensation, reporting issues, etc)
- Moderate three major communication channels: #transifex Slack channel, announcements in Transifex, Bisq forum.

### Secondary
Foster collaboration among translators on current and future projects by reaching out to them, setting up group calls, etc.

#### Transifex Language Teams
Establish and coordinate active language teams with the members of each team collaborating closely to produce quality translations. 

#### Glossary and Style Guide Initiative
Oversee the creation of a comprehensive glossary that is consistent across all core languages and a style guide that can set standards for all translations.

#### Translator Documentation
Create documentation that can help new and current translators do their work efficiently.
