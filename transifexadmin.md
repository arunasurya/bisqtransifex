# Transifex Admin

The Transifex admin role is shared by two contributors, one acting in the primary role, and the other acting in the secondary role. This is done to ensure a smooth workflow. The current transifex admins as of April 2019 are @ripcurlx and @arunasurya.

Any Bisq contributor who has been an active translator and reviewer, and has worked closely with the current admins in coordinating the project, can become an admin once the position is open.

## Tasks
The tasks are divided between the two Transifex admins. The admin acting in the primary role coordinates these activities to ensure that all the primary tasks are done in a timely manner.

### Primary
- Create [monthly reports](https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/20).
- Update the translations for all core languages for each [new release](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestones).
  - Inform the translators of the planned update, ideally a week before it happens, and remind them to review their strings in the software.
- Provide clear and updated documentation to help translators do their work effectively.
    - [Translation Guidelines](translationguidelines.md)
    - [Translator Documentation](translatordocumentation.md)
- Moderate three major communication channels: #transifex Slack channel, announcements in Transifex, Bisq forum.
- Keep general information on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bisq/bisq-desktop/settings/) up-to-date to inform new translators.

### Secondary

#### Regular Translator Calls
Foster collaboration among translators on current and future projects by bringing them together in monthly translator calls. The first call is planned for the second week of May.

#### Transifex Language Teams
Establish and coordinate active language teams with the members of each team collaborating closely to produce quality translations. 

#### Glossary and Style Guide Initiative
Oversee the creation of a comprehensive glossary that is consistent across all core languages and a style guide that can set standards for all translations.
