# Transifex Admin

The Transifex admin role is shared by two contributors, one acting in the primary role, and the other acting in the secondary role. This is done to ensure a smooth workflow.

Any Bisq contributor who has been an active translator and reviewer, and has worked closely with the current admins in coordinating the project, can become an admin once the position is open.

## Tasks
The tasks are divided between the two Transifex admins. The admin acting in the primary role coordinates these activities to ensure that all the primary tasks are done in a timely manner.

### Primary
- Create [monthly reports](https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/20).
- Accept new translators, assign translators as reviewers, coordinators, etc on Transifex.
- Update the translations for all core languages for each [new release](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestones).
  - Inform the translators of the planned update, ideally a week before it happens.
- Provide clear documentation to help translators do their work effectively. Update monthly or/and when needed.
