# Bisq Transifex Project

##  Introduction
The aim of the Bisq Transifex Project is to produce technically accurate and up-to-date translations of the Bisq desktop application and relevant Bisq sites from English into other languages.

All translations are done on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bisq/), and we currently have three projects there:
- #bisq-desktop, the most crucial part of the project which involves translation of the Bisq software. 
- bisq-website, which involves translating [the Bisq landing page](https://bisq.network/) and other sites that provide important information about the app to users.
- Bisq Subtitles, which provides subtitles for some Bisq videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/bisq-network).

## Core Languages
The Bisq software is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), French, Russian, German, Chinese (Mandarin and traditional), Japanese, Persian, Thai and Vietnamese. These are core languages the work for which is compensated. This list can change depending on the demand among users, feedback from other contributors, etc.

To add a language to the core group, a translator needs to submit a proposal to be voted on in a DAO cycle. A core language that has not provided value or has been inactive can be removed from the list. Here are the guidelines for submitting a proposal to add a language to or remove it from the core group.

## Roles
The Transifex team consists of translators, reviewers, coordinators and admins.

### Translators
Anyone is welcome to become a translator by creating an account on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bisq) and requesting permission to translate. Please note that although we welcome your contributions in a language of your choice, currently only translations for core languages are being compensated.

### Reviewers
Those translators who have been regular contributors and have shown solid knowledge of their language are given access to review. You can find more guidelines on translations and reviews [here](translationguidelines.md).

### Coordinators
In Transifex, each language team has a coordinator who is available to answer questions from other translators and provide any technical help if needed.

### Admins
There are two admins in the project. An admin acting in the primary role ensures that all essential tasks have been completed. Any coordinator who has contributed on a regular basis can become an admin once the position is open

#### Responsibilities
Admins have the following responsibilities:
- Create [monthly reports](https://github.com/bisq-network/roles/issues/20).
- Host [monthly translator calls](translatorcalls.md).
- Accept new translators, assign translators as reviewers and coordinators on Transifex.
- Update translations for all core languages in the [new client release](https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/milestones).
  - Inform translators of the planned update, ideally a week before it happens.
- Provide clear documentation to help translators do their work effectively. Update monthly or/and when needed.
- Review statistics (YouTube, etc) to evaluate the level of activity in a language.
- Moderate three major communication channels: #transifex keybase channel, announcements in Transifex, Bisq forum.
- Keep general information in *Setting* on Transifex up-to-date (for all Transifex projects).
- Keep track of issues on Transifex and coordinate the process of addressing these issues in [this query](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P4JMLrcRtSWkxfh9jG7AXkfdgdkEYwgttGgly-ercXc/edit#gid=0).
- Establish and coordinate active language teams, and ensure that the team structure is updated on Transifex.
- Oversee the creation of a comprehensive glossary that is consistent across all core languages, and a style guide that can set standards for all translations.
