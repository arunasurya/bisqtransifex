# Bisq Transifex Project

##  Introduction

The aim of the Bisq Transifex Project is to produce technically accurate and up-to-date translations of the Bisq desktop application and relevant Bisq sites from English into other languages.

All translations are done on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bisq/), and we currently have three projects there:
- #bisq-desktop, the most crucial part of the project which involves translation of the Bisq software. 
- bisq-website, which focuses on translating [the Bisq landing page](https://bisq.network/) and other sites that provide important information about the app to users.
- Bisq Subtitles, which provides subtitles for some Bisq videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/bisq-network).

## Core Languages
The Bisq software is available in English, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), French, Russian, German, Chinese (Mandarin and traditional), Japanese, Persian, Thai and Vietnamese. These are core languages the work for which is compensated. This list can change depending on the demand among users for a new language, feedback from other contributors, stats, etc.

To add a language to the core group, a translator needs to submit a proposal to be voted on in a DAO cycle. A core language that has not provided value can also be removed from the list. Here are the guidelines for submitting a proposal to add or remove a language from the core group.

## The Team
The Transifex team consists of translators, reviewers, coordinators and admins.

### Translators
Anyone is welcome to become a translator by creating an account on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bisq) and requesting permission to translate. Please note that although we welcome your contributions in a language of your choice, currently only translations for core languages are being compensated.

### Reviewers
Those translators who have been regular contributors and have shown solid knowledge of their language are given access to review. You can find more guidelines on translations and reviews [here](translationguidelines.md).

### Coordinators
Each language team has a coordinator who can assist other translators and reviewers on a daily basis. Coordinators work closely with admins to ensure a smooth workflow. 

### Admins
There are two admins in the team, one acting in the primary role, and the other in the secondary role. Any coordinator who has contributed on a regular basis can become an admin.
