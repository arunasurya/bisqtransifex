*“Fundamentally, translation is about understanding the source document, understanding the subject matter, and writing well.”* 
                                                                                 - A guide to translation project management

## Introduction
These are some guidelines to help Bisq translators understand the project better and produce high quality translations.

## Glossary
- A glossary is needed to provide consistent translations of high frequency terms (such as transaction, private/public key, etc). 
- This initiative is lead by @y3v63n, and the updates are communicated on the #transifex Slack channel.

## Style Guide
TBD

## Reviews
- Reviews involve checking the translation thoroughly against the original.
- Ideally, the reviews are done on someone else's translations.
- All changes in terminology need to be consistent throughout the text, and in the glossary. 

## Transifex-specific
- Make sure that there are no empty spaces after each translation.
- Quality Assurance in Transifex.
