# Translation Guidelines

“Fundamentally, translation is about understanding the source document, understanding the subject matter, and writing well.” 
                                                                                 - A guide to translation project management

## Translators
- It is best to have a single translator or a small, collaborative team of translators in a language team. 
- Most (though not all) professional translators translate into their native language only.
  - Ideally, have an expert in the field (technical background) translate into his/her native language. 

## Review/edits
- Editing involves checking the translation thoroughly against the original. 
- All changes in terminology need to be consistent throughout the text, and in the glossary. 
- Normally, there is also a proofreading step, but we will combine the review and proofreading in one step.

## Transifex-specific
- Make sure that there are no empty spaces after each translation.
