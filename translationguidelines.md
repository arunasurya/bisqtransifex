# Translation Guidelines

*“Fundamentally, translation is about understanding the source document, understanding the subject matter, and writing well.”* 
                                                                                 - A guide to translation project management

## Introduction
The aim of this document is to establish guidelines to help Bisq translators produce high quality translations, up to par with that of translation agencies.

## Translators
- It is best to have at least **two translators** in each language team, with one person translating a specific part of the document, and another - reviewing the doc.
- The translators in each language team should work closely and coordinate their work.

## Review/edits
- Editing involves checking the translation thoroughly against the original. 
- All changes in terminology need to be consistent throughout the text, and in the glossary. 
- Normally, there is also a proofreading step, but we will combine the review and proofreading in one step.

## Transifex-specific
- Make sure that there are no empty spaces after each translation.
