## Compensation Requests
Here are some guidelines for gauging your compensation request, based on the recent requests that have been approved:
- https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/240
- https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/241

As of this moment, we are using the following rates for translations, based on the past compensation requests:
0.07BSQ per word for translations, 0.035BSQ per word for reviews.
 
There was a lot of [discussion](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/96) on this topic, and there is still no consensus on the rates. With time, as more translators submit their requests, a more consistent compensation range for translations and reviews will arise. Don't forget to make a compensation request proposal in the Bisq DAO and link your github request there.

### Details of your work
- Please submit details of your work in your request. This is done to help the stakeholders validate your request.
- For translators:
  - Choose among filters *status: translated*, pick your name/nick in *users: translator*, and the translation period in *date: translated after/before* to specify the translation work to be compensated.
- For reviewers: use *status: reviewed*, *users: reviewer*.
- After that, tick the box right to the filter field to select all strings, and you will see the total wordcount for the selected strings.
- Please take snapshots of all your work for a certain period and include them in your compensation request. 
- Here is an example of screenshots for reviewing a translation.
