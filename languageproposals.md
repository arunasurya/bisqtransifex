# Language Proposals

The Bisq software is currently available in English, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal), French, Russian, German, Chinese (Mandarin and traditional), Japanese, Persian, Thai and Vietnamese. These are core languages the work for which is compensated.

## Criteria for Core Languages

The core language list is based on several factors such as:
- The number of speakers worldwide in that language (e.g., Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese and Mandarin Chinese).
- Trading activity in that language (e.g., Portuguese, Spanish).
- Competence in English among speakers of a certain language (e.g., Japanese).
- Translator activity level (those languages that have not had active translators for some time are likely to be removed from the list).
- Importance of introducing Bisq to specific countries.

## Adding a Language to the Core Group

To add a language to the core group, a contributor needs to submit [a proposal](https://docs.bisq.network/proposals.html) to be voted on in a DAO cycle. Prior to submittig a proposal, it may be best to discuss your ideas on #transifex channel on Keybase and engage other translators as well as admins in the discussion.

Please provide solid reasons to add your language to the core list. This will make it more likely for Bisq stakeholders to approve your proposal. A new language is most likely to be accepted if there is an active effort to create a community and user base in that language, e.g., via meetups, [liquidity weeks](https://github.com/bisq-network/compensation/issues/62), forums, etc. 

Once the proposal is accepted by stakeholders, a Bisq developer sends a pull request to add the language and one of the admins will accept it.

Unlike typical companies, Bisq aims to increase its user base in an organic, privacy-preserving manner. This means that we don't want to do typical marketing or work with ad providers that snoop into users' privacy. Ideally, a group of contributors will act in a coordinated manner to educate potential users about Bisq via meetups, etc. So, in short, this is a dynamic process and is mostly dependent on user activity level in a certain language.

If there is an increased interest in a language, say Italian, and if it is accepted to the core list, then the past translations are compensated.

## Removing a Language from the Core Group

A core language that has not provided value or has been inactive can be removed from the list. If there is no or a substantially decreased user interest in some of the current core languages, or no translator activity, those languages may be removed from the list. This applies especially to those languages that are not widely spoken or if they are in the European Union. If a language (such as Greek) has been part of the core language list and was recently removed, the past work for that language is still compensated. 

To remove a language from the core list, an admin submits a proposal on Bisq DAO. As soon as it is accepted, a pull request is sent to remove the language, and one of Transifex admins will accept that request.
