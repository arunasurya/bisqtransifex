# A Proposal to establish a more official Bisq Transifex Team Structure

## Current State
Currently there is no clear structure in the Bisq Transifex team apart from having two official admins.
Anyone can send a request to join a language team or add a language, and there has not been defined a systematic process on
accepting/denying these requests. All requests to join a team are accepted. We have over 30 languages and 160+ translators 
in Transifex, but only 12 of those are core, and a small fraction of the translators contribute consistenly. 

## Proposal
Given these factors, I propose a team structure that should make the workflow efficient due to clearly defined tasks.
