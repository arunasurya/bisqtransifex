# Proposal for a new Bisq Transifex Team Structure

## Current State
Currently the Bisq Transifex team has no clear organizational structure, apart from having two official admins and dozens of translators, all of whom working remotely across different time zones. We have over 30 languages and 160+ translators on the Transifex platform, but only 12 of those languages are core (the work for which is compensated), and only a fraction of the translators contribute regularly. 

Since Bisq is an open source project, anyone can become a translator by sending a request to join on Transifex, and all requests to translate are accepted. There is no systematic process to assess and verify the quality of translations and evaluate their usage. There have been some big changes in the client, so there is a strong need for ensuring that all participating translators have a moderately good understanding of the software to be able to convey it in their language.

Since there are no clearly defined roles for most contributors in the team, some contributions may not get fully recognized and properly compensated, which can lead to resentment and loss of trust in the project. Lack of accountability can lead to a sporadic workflow, and lack of hierarchy can cause delays or uncertainty in some projects.

While we have two admins, one of them (@ripcurlx) is also highly involved in many vital Bisq projects thart require his attention, and the other (@arunasurya) is not available full time. 

## Proposal
Given these factors, I propose the following team structure. The benefits are:
- Responsibility increases with experience
While anyone can become a translator, one needs to demonstrate high level of competence in their language to gain access to review. Those reviewers who further improve the software or/and translations by finding bugs, reporting issues, etc, can beomce coordinators, and can ask for compensation for those various tasks they have performed.



### Team Structure
I propose the following team structure which mirrors the one in Transifex official documentation but is also substantially simplified.

The Bisq Transifex team consists of two admins, 12 coordinators, and many reviewers and translators. The admins encompass three Transifex roles (an admin, a project maintainer and a team manager). A project maintainer role can also be shared with other contributors whose work is vital to a specific project.

### Admins
Admins may decide between themselves how to best split the responsibilities. At times, both admins are very active in the project, at other times, one may take over most of the tasks. In any case, there is continuous communication between them. Admins are ultimately responsible for the timely and consistent delivery of the high quality product (translations). Only one of the admins has access to merge changes to the software and update translations for each new release. They should have both a high level and a detailed view of the project.

### Coordinators
A coordinator oversees activities in a specific language.

### Priviledges
A coordinator has access to the following features in their specific language:
- Accept/deny join requests and invite translators.
- Assign some translators as reviewers.
- Start a team discussion.
- Review translations.
- Submit translations.

### Responsibilities
A coordinator is responsible for ensuring the quality, consistency and timeliness of translations in their language.
Coordinators actively participate in the Bisq DAO by voting up or down proposals by the translators in their team. In addition, a coordinator is available to guide new translators, help resolve Transifex issues in their language, and explore opportunities to expand Bisq in their region. Any coordinator who has contributed on a regular basis can become an admin once the position is open.


### Budget
I believe that the Bisq team should have a clear budget which includes:
- Compensation for translators and reviewers.
- Compensation for active contributors.
- Compensation for project maintainers who are not involved in the project full time.
- Compensation for admins.
