# A Proposal to establish a more official Bisq Transifex Team Structure

## Current State
Currently there is no clear structure in the Bisq Transifex team apart from having two official admins. We have over 30 languages and 160+ translators in Transifex, but only 12 of those are core, and a small fraction of the translators contribute consistenly. Anyone can send a request to join a language team or add a language, and all requests to join a team are accepted.

The lack of clear team structure combined with remote work results in overlooking important issues.

## Proposal
Given these factors, I propose a team structure that should make the workflow efficient due to clearly defined tasks.

### Team Structure
I propose a team structure which mirrors the one in Transifex official documentation but is also substantially simplified.
We already have two admins but one of them (@ripcurlx) is also responsible for many vital Bisq projects and the other 
(@arunasurya) is not available full time. 

The Bisq Transifex team consists of two admins, 12 coordinators, and many reviewers and translators. The admins encompass three Transifex roles (an admin, a project maintainer and a team manager). A project maintainer role can also be shared with other contributors whose work is vital to a specific project.

## Coordinators
A coordinator oversees activities in a specific language.

### Priviledges
A coordinator has access to the following features in their specific language:
- Accept/deny join requests and invite translators.
- Assign some translators as reviewers.
- Start a team discussion.
- Review translations.
- Submit translations.

### Responsibilities
A coordinator is responsible for ensuring the quality, consistency and timeliness of translations in their language.
Coordinators actively participate in the Bisq DAO by voting up or down proposals by the translators in their team. In addition, a coordinator is available to guide new translators, help resolve Transifex issues in their language, and explore opportunities to expand Bisq in their region. Any coordinator who has contributed on a regular basis can become an admin once the position is open.
